Bunny Studio Test

This test consisted of creating an MVP that implemented a micro-service architecture. 
Two services were created, which can be found here:

UserAPI - https://stark-peak-76795.herokuapp.com/users-crud-rest/users

UserTaskAPI - https://calm-headland-79271.herokuapp.com/usertasks-crud-rest/userTasks/

These two services are consumed by a web application created with angular. 

To run the web application, it is necessary to set up the local environment and workspace. To do so, please follow the instructions found for Steps 1 and 2 here: https://angular.io/guide/setup-local.

Once the environment is set up, please download the project files from: https://github.com/angelacgr91/Bunny-Studio-Front.git.

You need to generate the node_modules folder in order to be able to deploy the app correctly. In the terminal console, go to the folder where you downloaded the project using the cd command. Once here, use the following command: npm i  .

Finally, use the following command: ng serve --open  .
