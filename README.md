Bunny Studio Test

This test consisted of creating an MVP that implemented a micro-service architecture. 
Two services were created, which can be found here:
UserAPI - https://stark-peak-76795.herokuapp.com/users-crud-rest/users
UserTaskAPI - https://calm-headland-79271.herokuapp.com/usertasks-crud-rest/userTasks/

This two services are consumed by a web application created with angular.
